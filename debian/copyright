This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-pkgkitten package of pkgkitten.  The
pkgkitten package helps in creating simple skeleton R packages.
It was written by Dirk Eddelbuettel.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'pkgKitten' to
'r-cran-pkgkitten' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages
for R.

   Description: Provides a function kitten() which create cute little 
    packages which pass R CMD check. This sets it apart from 
    package.skeleton() which it calls, and which leaves imperfect files 
    behind. As this is not exactly helpful for beginners, kitten() offers 
    an alternative.
