Description: GNU R package to create simple packages
 This package provides a function kitten() which create cute little 
 packages which pass R CMD check. This sets it apart from 
 package.skeleton() which it calls, and which leaves imperfect files 
 behind. As this is not exactly helpful for beginners, kitten() offers 
 an alternative.
